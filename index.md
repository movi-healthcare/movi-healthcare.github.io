# Awesome Jobs

Updated: 10/20/2020

Exciting things are happening here at Movi.  Our platform has been validated as an ecosystem with value add to ALL participants in the business process.  This translates into expanding our current offerings while also creating new ones. :boom:

We're looking to hire all levels of software engineers so don't hesitate to submit your resume if a job description below does not match your experience to a :tea:


- [Team Player Engineer](http://b.link/movi-github-team-player): Mid-level aka intermediate is passé...and we really don't want to put someone in a box. We want someone who plans on advancing quickly and help the greater good of the team as you grow.

- [Quality Team Player](http://b.link/movi-github-quality-team-player): QA Engineer is too QA-y and isn't exactly what we're seeking....we're looking for someone who likes the Quality Assurance aspects of software development, particularly automated testing but can also participate in other areas of the development cycle.  We're small and it's all hands on deck!

- FHIRperson: No job description needed (look at the other jobs for general info, benefits, etc)...if you know what FHIR means, send us your resume stat! :fire:

If you think you don't match these criteria but are interesting in all things Movi...we're happy to entertain hiring all levels/areas of skill.

Send resumes to jobs@movihealthcare.com

\* This is written from the context of a non-pandemic environment...hopefully we’re out of this soon enough and will be high-fivin’ at the office!
